# SBOX-Signature-RSA
The whole implementation of the digital signature starts by taking a sequence of real
random numbers through a generator created in the previous labs. The generator is based on audio samples that were later taken by post-processing
using SBOXes.

## Installation

In order to run the app install packages by command (depends on the python version): 

```bash
pip3.10 install -r req.txt
```
